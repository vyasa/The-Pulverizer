you are reading the plaintext of the second assignment for our cryptography course.
this assignment has three parts to it. the first two parts have computer science and
mathematics options whereas the third part is common to both.
for the first part, analyze or implement a fast algorithm for multiplying two integers.
for the second part, analyze or implement a fast algorithm for division of two integers.
the implementation should allow for an arbitrary length input integers and may be written
in any programming language of your choice. the analysis should state explicitly the time
dependence on the lengths of the input numbers.
for the third part, write a short report on algorithms used for generating random integers. 
your report should include a list of citations to published scientific articles.
students enrolled in the graduate number of this course should do both the analysis and
implementation.
